# School-journal
A diary application for schoolchildren, partially replacing a standard diary. The application will contain several timesheets: one will look like a regular diary spread, used for recording homework, setting reminders, marking, etc.; the second will look like a page from a school magazine and will serve to monitor grades; It is also possible to create a third timesheet, which will be used to record notes assigned to certain dates. The application will also be useful for parents of a child who is not yet quite old enough (~12 years old). The parent will be able to set “reminders” conditionally about completing homework, so the parent will not have to “run around” and “manually” remind the child about homework.
